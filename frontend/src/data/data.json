I come from a background in mathematics and transitioned to Computer Engineering for my graduate studies at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm all about embracing life to the fullest! As someone who adores both domestic and international travel, you'll often find me exploring new destinations and soaking up the diverse cultures and experiences the world has to offer. Whether it's hiking through lush forests, strolling along bustling city streets, or lounging on pristine beaches, I'm always up for an adventure! When I'm not jet-setting around the globe, you can catch me unwinding with some yoga and Pilates to keep my mind and body in harmony. And let's not forget about my love for K-pop dancing \u2013 it's my go-to way to let loose and have a blast! Work hard, play hard \u2013 that's my motto. I believe in putting my all into everything I do, whether it's crafting websites or busting out some killer dance moves. Life's too short to not enjoy every moment, so let's make the most of it together! Looking forward to connecting with fellow travel enthusiasts and kindred spirits. Let's embark on this exciting journey together! Connect me on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sitong-shang-victoria/ (edited) 1 1 1",
